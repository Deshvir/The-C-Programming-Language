# The-C-Programming-Language

/** I am a passionate C programmer. Doing projects in C is a part of my hobby. Currently, I am doing my master's in Computer   #Engineering at the University of Maryland College Park. I believe C is very beautiful language if you want to work at system level. In this repository, I'll be solving all the problems of "The C Programming Language", second edition by K & R.
